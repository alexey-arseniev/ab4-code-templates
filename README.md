# ab4-code-templates
Here you can find an aternative code templates set for ABAP Editor used in ABAB Workbench (SE38).
To install temmplates to your PC, replace file:
- %APPDATA%\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor\abap_user.xml on your PC by file
- [abap_user.xml]((../blob/master/abap_zser.xml)) from repository.

**!Important!**
If your already have your own code templates (not SAP delivered templates, these ones are included) you will lose them after overwriting of the abap_user.xml. So, please backup the file before overwrite and copy you code templates from it (in text editor) after installation of alternative set.

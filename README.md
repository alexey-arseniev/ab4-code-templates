# ab4-code-templates
Here you can find an alternative code template set for ABAP Editor used in ABAB Workbench (SE38).
To install templates to your PC, replace the file:
- %APPDATA%\SAP\ABAP Editor\abap_user.xml on your PC by file
- [abap_user.xml]((../blob/master/abap_zser.xml)) from repository.

**!Important!**
If you already have your code templates (not SAP-delivered templates, these are included) you will lose them after overwriting the abap_user.xml. So, please backup the file before overwriting and copy your code templates from it (in the text editor) after installation of the alternative set.
